# Why We Exist
Our mission is to be the most helpful platform in the world for founders at the opening tip or first pitch of a new sports project, story or company. As our name suggests, we are here to partner with teams bringing a fresh perspective to sport and culture at-large. Through a mix of funding, creative direction and design services, our goal is to build a dialogue and community at the intersection of sport, commerce and creativity.

Unlike other industries and cultural categories, sports lacks the necessary framework to support new experiments and ideas. You can find a VC firm to invest in your sports idea, as long as it has a technology angle, but for those projects with the more DIY, grassroots, local ethos, we've yet to find a good crowdfunding tool, incubator, accelerator or co-working space to support these new projects. As the farmer's market empowered the local farmer, Kickstarter changed the game for creators and Y Combinator propped up early-stage technology companies, Dewy Grass Club wants to do the same for sports makers, growers and visionaries.
