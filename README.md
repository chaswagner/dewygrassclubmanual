# Why We Exist
Our mission is to be the most helpful platform in the world for founders at the opening tip or first pitch of a new sports project, story or company. As our name suggests, we are here to partner with teams bringing a fresh perspective to sport and culture at-large. Through a mix of funding, creative direction and design services, our goal is to build a dialogue and community at the intersection of sport, commerce and creativity.

Unlike other industries and cultural categories, sports lacks a robust framework to support new experiments and ideas. You can find a VC firm to invest in your sports idea, as long as it has a technology angle, but for those projects with the more DIY, grassroots, local ethos, we've yet to find a good crowdfunding tool, incubator, accelerator or co-working space to support these new projects. As the farmer's market empowered the local farmer, Kickstarter changed the game for creators and Y Combinator birthed a new breed of tech startups, Dewy Grass Club wants to do the same for sports makers, creators and visionaries.

We're here to be a fun-loving coach for the weird, experimental and avant-garde projects by and for the sports, outdoor and fitness community.

# Areas of Focus

1. * Books and Magazines * - printed matter matters. It can help tell the history of a club, league or coach, who made a huge impact on a local community. Just as an artists' book and cookbook looks at the life on an artist or chef, we'd like to explore athletes' and coaches' books. A more intimate, raw and visual look at life on and off the court. 
2. * Documentary Films * - 
3. * Spaces *
4. * Experiences *
5. * Sharing and Accessibility *
6. * Travel *
7. * Unsung Heroes * - tools for trainers, referees, youth coaches, grounds crew and other support staff. They make the sports engine go, yet little money or resources goes to making their jobs better, more efficient or rewarding.
